## Key diferences between relational databases and non-relational databses:
1. Relational databases use defined schemas with tables, rows and columns, changing the schema can be complex. Non-relational databases like MongoDB use a document-based structure with flexible schemas which allows changes to be made without affecting the data.
2. MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling and handling large volumes of unstructured data. MySQL is more structured in schema design and usually scales vertically.



  ## Healthcare-specific scenario
  Using a non-SQL database like MongoDb would be useful when managing patient records containing unstructured data such as images, text, notes etc. MongoDB's flexible schema model allows storing diverse patient data, making it easier to manage and retrieve complex medical records.
